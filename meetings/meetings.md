## Meetings

### Initial meeting - 

* Duration of about an hour, mainly introductions and where to go from here. Setting up further face to face meeting for all the associated level 4s

### Meeting 7 Oct

* Duration of around an hour, this was the first face-to-face meeting and served to clear up some misunderstandings about the project. Here the idea of building models from a previously run survey was put forward as well as rough information about the user study. This meeting helped me understand that the purpose of the project was to carry forward the work of the 3D-Auth paper from proof of concept to a more user friendly form. I was also given contact information to the Sirius research team and the previous resources that were used in the 3D-auth paper including models and an authentication app.

### Meeting 21 Oct

* Duration of around an hour, discussed the prototypes that I had come up with, writing the dissertation as well as the 3D printer. This meeting was good for making sure we were on the same page about the project as well as solidifying where to go from here. It was discussed that the user study would be planned to run for 2 weeks during January, meaning that all models would have to be designed and printed, ethical approval would have to be obtained, a concrete plan for the user study and the authentication app created and working. Here we discussed further the app as well, how it should send push notifications throughout the day as well as have some way of the user giving feedback on the workings of the model and where they authenticated their device.

### Meeting 28 Oct

* Duration of around 15 minutes, discussed issues the 3D printer was having - some problem with the IR sensor causing it to fail calibration tests - as well as handing over of a key to the room with the printer allowing access to it any time. Also discussed plans for a meeting with a colleague who would be helping with making the digital 3D models for printing

### Meeting 18 Nov

* Discussed the addition of a footprint for the models, since these are prototypes they don't need actual unique footprints, but some indication such as a pair dots or some other such thing would be good for this. Also discussed leaving out a subset of the interaction space due to them being fairly unfriendly anyway, ie the augmentation and the assembly ones. Quickly discussed the user study, don't need to do anything complicated, just the normal bits.
