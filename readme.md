# Abstract

This is the repository for the level 4 study done on Tangible 2-Factor Authentication, a study put forward 
by Karola Marky, and performed by Mark Turner (2386300T) at the University of Glasgow. The project aims to assess the
usability of 3D printed objects as every-day authentication devices for touchscreens (in this project the
focus is on smart phones running android) by performing a 2 week user study on members of the general population.
