## Model

This directory contains the model files for each of those that were 
completed, each within their own folder:

* `Animal - Configuration\` Contains the animal model, which was decided to be too complicated and require too much printing time to take part in the study
* `Circle Coin - Arrangement` Contains the coin model, which was removed from the study due to limitations in android's MotionEvent tracking
* `Credit card - Touch` Contains the credit card model, which made it into the study
* `Cube - Arrangement` Contains the original cube model, which made it into the study
* `Cube Variation - Arrangement` Contains a variant of the cube model, which was made to demonstrate possible methods of footprint placement
* `G-code` Contains the gcode files created from the final models, each of which sliced in PrusaSlicer
* `Pendant - Configuration` Contains the pendant model, which made it into the study
* `Square - Assembly` Contains the square models, which were ejected from th study due to the requirement of multiple parts being too cumbersome

The gcode was generated with the models as is, as well as using the default 15mm quality preset for printing 
the final study models.
