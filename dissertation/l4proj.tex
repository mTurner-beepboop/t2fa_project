%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
   ``Two-factor authentication is already a widely used and recommended method of securing one's data, however most of the preferred solutions tend to remain in the digital space.  This project investigated the usability of tangible, 3D-printed objects that made use of a conductive form of plastic to interact with a capacitive touch screen. Building on the prototyping done by Marky et al. this paper finds whether these types of models can compare to existing two-factor authentication solutions while proposing potentially viable developed models and assessing them in a week long study. This is a particularly intresting area with 3D-printing, and while still being in its infancy, may offer an easy way to provide tangible security in the future, an area which in the past has failed. It was found during the user study that --hopefully the models stand up to current 2-factor authentication methods, potentially leading to further development of tangible security for mobile devices as 3D-printing develops as well as showing a clear increase in performance over the week indicating that retention of the methods of use was good. --or, that the current models proved to be too cumbersome for users to utilise as authentication methods and ended up as impractical and difficult to use, suggesting that the convenience offered by purely digital methods will lead to continued focus over methods such as this. ``

Why should the reader care about what are you doing and what are you actually doing?

Things to discuss for me:
The reason for authentications - ie the reason to even look at this
Current two-factor authentication methods
Why these methods are prevalent/ the failings of other tangible 2fa methods
The current spread of 3D printing and why this technology would be useful for this task
Reusibility of these models without compromising security like with passwords and such due to the 2 factor nature being built in to the object (knowledge and ownership)




As our lives have already become so strongly linked to the digital space, the need for security has become more prevalent, and already we see users authenticating themselves multiple times throughout the day. As well with many accounts and secure systems recommending two-factor authentication and touch screens becoming ubiquitous, finding themselves in more and more places.......



With touchscreens becoming ubiquitous and the devices using them requiring authentication more frequently, fast and simple methods have become the preferred way to access devices and accounts, with pins and patterns taking precedence over more secure 2-factor methods [citation needed]. As such, the importance for a method of secure authentication that users will happily use has become greater over the years, as too many 2-factor methods are considered cumbersome and a waste of time[citation needed], forcing users to jump back and forth between tabs and devices or waiting for codes to generate. 

This project presents Tangible 2-Factor Authentication (T2FA), a simple method of 2-factor authentication using a physical, 3D-printed model and a capacitive touchscreen device to validate a user's identity through ownership of the object and the knowledge of how to use it. The object, using an interaction space previously defined by Marky et al.[citation needed], takes the form of a small, everyday object with touch points encoded in the model's structure made from a conductive plastic that interpret the user's interaction with the model and convey it onto their touchscreen device to prove their identity. The two factors in the object for secure authentication are dealt with as follows: Ownership is expressed both through the existence of the model in the user's possesion as well as a touchpoint footprint to ensure that even if multiple users have the same model, they are still each unique and can only unlock their specific linked devices; Knowledge is expressed through the interaction the user performs with the object, such as moving the object in a certain way, or touching specific points on the object. This ensures that even should the object fall into someone else's hands, the device will remain secure, or vice versa, and with the objects taking the form of everyday items, their inconspicuousness leads to the likelyhood of both device and model being obtained by a potential attacker being low.

The integration these models intrisicly have with 3D printing is intentional, with commercial 3D printers slowly becoming more widespread, there may be a time where they are commonplace in homes, allowing for (services/companies?) like banks to have their own object creation pipeline to create models for customers that they could then print. (This seems really clumsy)





\section{Guidance}

\textbf{Motivate} first, then state the general problem clearly. 

\section{Writing guidance}
\subsection{Who is the reader?}

This is the key question for any writing. Your reader:

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    is a trained computer scientist: \emph{don't explain basics}.
    \item
    has limited time: \emph{keep on topic}.
    \item
    has no idea why anyone would want to do this: \emph{motivate clearly}
    \item
    might not know \emph{anything} about your project in particular:
    \emph{explain your project}.
    \item
    but might know precise details and check them: \emph{be precise and
    strive for accuracy.}
    \item
    doesn't know or care about you: \emph{personal discussions are
    irrelevant}.
\end{itemize}

Remember, you will be marked by your supervisor and one or more members
of staff. You might also have your project read by a prize-awarding
committee or possibly a future employer. Bear that in mind.

\subsection{References and style guides}
There are many style guides on good English writing. You don't need to
read these, but they will improve how you write.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    \emph{How to write a great research paper} \cite{Pey17} (\textbf{recommended}, even though you aren't writing a research paper)
    \item
    \emph{How to Write with Style} \cite{Von80}. Short and easy to read. Available online.
    \item
    \emph{Style: The Basics of Clarity and Grace} \cite{Wil09} A very popular modern English style guide.
    \item
    \emph{Politics and the English Language} \cite{Orw68}  A famous essay on effective, clear writing in English.
    \item
    \emph{The Elements of Style} \cite{StrWhi07} Outdated, and American, but a classic.
    \item
    \emph{The Sense of Style} \cite{Pin15} Excellent, though quite in-depth.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Citation styles}

\begin{itemize}
\item If you are referring to a reference as a noun, then cite it as: ``\citet{Orw68} discusses the role of language in political thought.''
\item If you are referring implicitly to references, use: ``There are many good books on writing \citep{Orw68, Wil09, Pin15}.''
\end{itemize}

There is a complete guide on good citation practice by Peter Coxhead available here: \url{http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxc/refs/index.html}. 
If you are unsure about how to cite online sources, please see this guide: \url{https://student.unsw.edu.au/how-do-i-cite-electronic-sources}.

\subsection{Plagiarism warning}

\begin{highlight_title}{WARNING}
    
    If you include material from other sources without full and correct attribution, you are commiting plagiarism. The penalties for plagiarism are severe.
    Quote any included text and cite it correctly. Cite all images, figures, etc. clearly in the caption of the figure.

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Background}
What did other people do, and how is it relevant to what you want to do?


A section on 3d printing interactive items

A section on two factor authentication

A section on past tangible authentication methods



\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}    
    \item
      Don't give a laundry list of references.
    \item
      Tie everything you say to your problem.
    \item
      Present an argument.
    \item Think critically; weigh up the contribution of the background and put it in context.    
    \item
      \textbf{Don't write a tutorial}; provide background and cite
      references for further information.
\end{itemize}

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Analysis/Requirements}
What is the problem that you want to solve, and how did you arrive at it?

Upon analysis, it was clear that there was to be 4 main areas of development: analysis of the survey research, design and development of potntial models, creation of an app to simulate the use of authentication throughout the day, and design and analysis of a user study. Here, each of these main areas will be discussed in turn.

\section{Survey Analysis}

\section{Model Creation}

\section{Authentication Application}

\section{Study}

\section{Guidance}
Make it clear how you derived the constrained form of your problem via a clear and logical process. 

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Design}
How is this problem to be approached, without reference to specific implementation details? 
\section{Guidance}
Design should cover the abstract design in such a way that someone else might be able to do what you did, but with a different language or library or tool.

%==================================================================================================================================
\chapter{Implementation}
What did you do to implement this idea, and what technical achievements did you make?


Implementation included the creation of digital models, as well as how the models interact with the phone touch screen - number of touch points, maybe difficulty of creating recognisable footprint due to caapacitive data being unavailable


\section{Guidance}
You can't talk about everything. Cover the high level first, then cover important, relevant or impressive details.



\section{General points}

These points apply to the whole dissertation, not just this chapter.



\subsection{Figures}
\emph{Always} refer to figures included, like Figure \ref{fig:relu}, in the body of the text. Include full, explanatory captions and make sure the figures look good on the page.
You may include multiple figures in one float, as in Figure \ref{fig:synthetic}, using \texttt{subcaption}, which is enabled in the template.



% Figures are important. Use them well.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{images/relu.pdf}    

    \caption{In figure captions, explain what the reader is looking at: ``A schematic of the rectifying linear unit, where $a$ is the output amplitude,
    $d$ is a configurable dead-zone, and $Z_j$ is the input signal'', as well as why the reader is looking at this: 
    ``It is notable that there is no activation \emph{at all} below 0, which explains our initial results.'' 
    \textbf{Use vector image formats (.pdf) where possible}. Size figures appropriately, and do not make them over-large or too small to read.
    }

    % use the notation fig:name to cross reference a figure
    \label{fig:relu} 
\end{figure}

        \caption{Synthetic image, black on white.}
        \label{fig:syn1}
    \end{subfigure}
    ~ %add desired spacing between images, e. g. ~, \quad, \qquad, \hfill etc. 
      %(or a blank line to force the subfigure onto a new line)

    \caption{Synthetic test images for edge detection algorithms. \subref{fig:syn1} shows various gray levels that require an adaptive algorithm. \subref{fig:syn2}
    shows more challenging edge detection tests that have crossing lines. Fusing these into full segments typically requires algorithms like the Hough transform.
    This is an example of using subfigures, with \texttt{subref}s in the caption.
    }\label{fig:synthetic}

\subsection{Equations}

Equations should be typeset correctly and precisely. Make sure you get parenthesis sizing correct, and punctuate equations correctly 
(the comma is important and goes \textit{inside} the equation block). Explain any symbols used clearly if not defined earlier. 

For example, we might define:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{f}(\xi) = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(x) e^{2\pi i x \xi} \right],
\end{equation}    
where $\hat{f}(\xi)$ is the Fourier transform of the time domain signal $f(x)$.

\subsection{Algorithms}
Algorithms can be set using \texttt{algorithm2e}, as in Algorithm \ref{alg:metropolis}.

% NOTE: line ends are denoted by \; in algorithm2e
\begin{algorithm}
    \DontPrintSemicolon
    \KwData{$f_X(x)$, a probability density function returing the density at $x$.\; $\sigma$ a standard deviation specifying the spread of the proposal distribution.\;
    $x_0$, an initial starting condition.}
    \KwResult{$s=[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, $n$ samples approximately drawn from a distribution with PDF $f_X(x)$.}
    \Begin{
        $s \longleftarrow []$\;
        $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
        $i \longleftarrow 0$\;
        \While{$i < n$}
        {
            $x^\prime \longleftarrow \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$\;
            $p^\prime \longleftarrow f_X(x^\prime)$\;
            $a \longleftarrow \frac{p^\prime}{p}$\;
            $r \longleftarrow U(0,1)$\;
            \If{$r<a$}
            {
                $x \longleftarrow x^\prime$\;
                $p \longleftarrow f_X(x)$\;
                $i \longleftarrow i+1$\;
                append $x$ to $s$\;
            }
        }
    }
    
\caption{The Metropolis-Hastings MCMC algorithm for drawing samples from arbitrary probability distributions, 
specialised for normal proposal distributions $q(x^\prime|x) = \mathcal{N}(x, \sigma^2)$. The symmetry of the normal distribution means the acceptance rule takes the simplified form.}\label{alg:metropolis}
\end{algorithm}

\subsection{Tables}

If you need to include tables, like Table \ref{tab:operators}, use a tool like https://www.tablesgenerator.com/ to generate the table as it is
extremely tedious otherwise. 

\begin{table}[]

    captions go above the table, not below. Do not add additional rules/lines to tables. }\label{tab:operators}

\chapter{Evaluation} 
How good is your solution? How well did you solve the general problem, and what evidence do you have to support that?


This will be the place where I analyse the results from the study and find how well people liked the models


\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Ask specific questions that address the general problem.
    \item
        Answer them with precise evidence (graphs, numbers, statistical
        analysis, qualitative analysis).
    \item
        Be fair and be scientific.
    \item
        The key thing is to show that you know how to evaluate your work, not
        that your work is the most amazing product ever.
\end{itemize}

\section{Evidence}
Make sure you present your evidence well. Use appropriate visualisations, reporting techniques and statistical analysis, as appropriate.

If you visualise, follow the basic rules, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:boxplot}:
\begin{itemize}
\item Label everything correctly (axis, title, units).
\item Caption thoroughly.
\item Reference in text.
\item \textbf{Include appropriate display of uncertainty (e.g. error bars, Box plot)}
\item Minimize clutter.
\end{itemize}

See the file \texttt{guide\_to\_visualising.pdf} for further information and guidance.

    \caption{Average number of fingers detected by the touch sensor at different heights above the surface, averaged over all gestures. Dashed lines indicate
    the true number of fingers present. The Box plots include bootstrapped uncertainty notches for the median. It is clear that the device is biased toward 
    undercounting fingers, particularly at higher $z$ distances.

\chapter{Conclusion}    
Summarise the whole project for a lazy reader who didn't read the rest (e.g. a prize-awarding committee).

This paper investigated the usability and ease of retention of 3D-printed authentication objects, discussing previous work done in the area, the methodology used to develop new models to be evaluated and the potential future of this area. It was found that --users were bad at using them, definitely through no fault of my own --users enjoyed the experience of using them and they measured up well to existing methods of authentication --plus maybe some other comments here. It can be seen that the future of tangible authentication is --good --bad

\section{Guidance}
\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Summarise briefly and fairly.
    \item
        You should be addressing the general problem you introduced in the
        Introduction.        
    \item
        Include summary of concrete results (``the new compiler ran 2x
        faster'')
    \item
        Indicate what future work could be done, but remember: \textbf{you
        won't get credit for things you haven't done}.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Acknowledgements}
This paper would not have been possible without the help of my colleague Laszlo Besenyei at the University of Strathclyde, who provided a great service with the digital modelling of the objects, as well as Mohammed Khamis, who allowed me to intrude on his office for more than three months. I would also like to thank Karola Marky, my supervisor on this project, for lending her knowledge and support.

%  APPENDICES  

\begin{appendices}

\chapter{Appendices}

Things I'm gonna need for the appendices - Ethics approval forms, the survey(s) used, other documents created for use by participants, model designs(?)

Typical inclusions in the appendices are:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Copies of ethics approvals (required if obtained)
\item
  Copies of questionnaires etc. used to gather data from subjects.
\item
  Extensive tables or figures that are too bulky to fit in the main body of
  the report, particularly ones that are repetitive and summarised in the body.

\item Outline of the source code (e.g. directory structure), or other architecture documentation like class diagrams.

\item User manuals, and any guides to starting/running the software.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Don't include your source code in the appendices}. It will be
submitted separately.

\end{appendices}
