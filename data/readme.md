## Data
Data from evaluation can be found here.

In the 'raw/past survey/' folder, there is currently the survey data that was performed before the project. This data was
transformed by removing those that failed the understanding questions and information on numbers of responses for sizes
shapes was added, with the resulting excel spreadsheet stored in 'processed/past survey/'

In 'raw/study' the data collected during the user study can be found, including the transcripts of exit interviews, logs
of data collected by the app during the study as well as responses from the initial and final surveys. In the survey_responses.csv file, 
the data colected from both surveys can be found, with the survey_variables_list.csv containing a list of the names of the columns in survey_responses.csv
ensuring context is available for the data. The processed data collected can be found in 'processed/study', with each file
 named according to its contents. Any scripts used to analyse the data from the study can be found in 'src/analysis_scripts'.
 
Collected consent forms for the user study can be found in 'data/ethics/' as well as in the 'ethics/' folder in the base directory, 
with related ethical documents not directly relating to participants stored in '/ethics/'
