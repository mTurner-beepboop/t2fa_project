## Week 5

### 2 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Created sheets with dimensions and such that the models can be build for most of the models and sent them to colleague

* *6 hours* Getting familiar with 3D-printer and troubleshooting an issue with the sensor, no luck that day

## Week 6

### 8 Nov 2021

* *2.5 hours* Attempted a small print as further trouble shooting, no luck either

### 10 Nov 2021

* *3 hours* Problem with printer fixed and understanding solidified, printed a small shape to make sure there were no problems with single material. Noted that there may be problem with multi material printing

### 12 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Organising some of the papers that informed sizes of the models

## Week 7

### 15 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Collaboration with colleague to produce some digital models, completed credit card and most of pendant, discovered issue with keyring

### 16 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Setting up and calibrating 3D printer for another test print

* *1 hour* Creating formal git repo for the project and adding some notes to it to flesh it out a bit

## Week 8

## Week 9

### 3 Dec 2021

* *2 hours* 3D-printer comepletely working now, with new IR sensor and full setup performed

### 5 Dec 2021

* *2 hours* Getting familiar with Andoroid studio, created quick hello world app and followed a simple tutorial

## Week 10

### 10 Dec 2021

* *3 hours* Creation of a simple test app to test out some different functions and such

### 11 Dec 2021

* *2 hours* Began researching how to push notifications through app, a lot harder than it seems

## Week 11

### 14 Dec 2021

* *2 hours* Found that the printer has a problem with bleeding colour, which would be okay for test models, but because of the conducting filament, there's a worry that it may disrupt how it interacts with the screen, messaged Marco and got some advice

* *5 hours* Attempted some different methods of scheduling notifications, so far no results. Also linked up old phone that can be tested on with the app to streamline manual tests a bit

### 16 Dec 2021

* *1 hour* Completed the status report and sent to supervisor

* *2 hours* Started a print to create a model for testing with the app

* *3 hours* Further work on the app, successfully created push notifications, and scheduling in short term, performing long term test

## Week 12

### 27 Dec 2021

* **

## Week 13

## Week 14

## Week 15

### 10 Jan 2022

* 2 hours* *New solution for sending notificaiton as previous one appeared to stop working for some reason

### 12 Jan 2022

*4 hours* *Moved notificaiton creator, fixed random number generation problem, added some relevant code from provided resources, added unit test for findAppropriateDelay and finished scheduling function

### 13 Jan 2022

*1 hour* *Removed email widget in bottom right, refactored notification into own package
*1 hour* *Altered firstStart to make sure data collection happens at the right time

### 14 Jan 2022

*1 hour* * Added check to notification to ensure no notifications are sent after study has elapsed
*2 hours * *Added file handling to the app, still needs to be checked and tested
* 1 hour* *Created utility function to allow easy saving to file (I also did some 3D printing this day)

### 15 Jan 2022

### 18 Jan 2022

*2 hours* *Work on setPoints method on app, still a lot of work to be done, also added a lot of descriptive comments

### 19 Jan 2022

*4 hours* *Problem with the wrong view being loaded has been fixed in app, so now checks on vaildation can be tested manually, AuthActivity more or less done now. More 3D printing

### 20 Jan 2022
