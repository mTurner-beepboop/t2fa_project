* **YOU MUST KEEP THIS UP TO DATE AND UNDER VERSION CONTROL.**
* This timelog should be filled out honestly, regularly (daily) and accurately. It is for *your* benefit.
* Follow the structure provided, grouping time by weeks.  Quantise time to the half hour.

## Week 1

### 4 Oct 2021

* *1 hour* Research into related papers and cited papers from provided basis paper
* *0.5 hours* Drew some basic designs of a new 'animal' model and 'rotational' model

## 5 Oct 2021

* *1 hour* Further research into related papers

## 6 Oct 2021

## 7 Oct 2021

* *1 hour* meeting with supervisor - cleared up ideas for project (make some designs based on a run survey)
* *0.5 hours* network with Morgan to collect some relevant info (a design they made and code for app)
* *0.5 hours* created a rough timeline for the project

## 8 Oct 2021

## Week 2

### 12 Oct 2021

* *0.5 hours* Downloaded and had preliminary look at survey resource

### 13 Oct 2021

### 14 Oct 2021

* *1 hour* Performed some analysis on numbers for desired shape, filtered responses by the understanding questions

### 15 Oct 2021

* *1 hour* Organised reference management and added previously read papers

### 16 Oct 2021

* *1.5 hours* Drew up some prototypes considering the different methods of interaction presented in the 3D-Auth paper for each of the 10 suggested objects

## Week 3

### 19 Oct 2021

* *2 hours* Further research reading and tidying of current relevant papers

### 21 Oct 2021

* *1 hour* Met with supervisor and discussed prototypes, 3D-printer, dissertation writing

### 22 Oct 2021

* *1 hour* Took prototypes previously created further, making draft blueprints

* *2 hours* Met with colleague to discuss creation of digital models for the object prototypes

## Week 4

### 28 Oct 2021

* *0.5 hours* Brief meeting with supervisor to get key to office for 3D printer and discuss moving forward with the model making

## Week 5

### 2 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Created sheets with dimensions and such that the models can be build for most of the models and sent them to colleague

### 4 Nov 2021

* *6 hours* Getting familiar with 3D-printer and troubleshooting an issue with the sensor, no luck that day

## Week 6

### 8 Nov 2021

* *2.5 hours* Attempted a small print as further trouble shooting, no luck either

### 10 Nov 2021

* *3 hours* Problem with printer fixed and understanding solidified, printed a small shape to make sure there were no problems with single material. Noted that there may be problem with multi material printing

### 12 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Organising some of the papers that informed sizes of the models

## Week 7

### 15 Nov 2021

* *1 hour* Collaboration with colleague to produce some digital models, completed credit card and most of pendant, discovered issue with keyring

### 16 Nov 2021

* *0.5 hour* Setting up and calibrating 3D printer for another test print

* *1 hour* Creating formal git repo for the project and adding some notes to it to flesh it out a bit

## Week 8

## Week 9

### 3 Dec 2021

* *2 hours* 3D-printer comepletely working now, with new IR sensor and full setup performed

### 5 Dec 2021

* *2 hours* Getting familiar with Andoroid studio, created quick hello world app and followed a simple tutorial

## Week 10

### 10 Dec 2021

* *3 hours* Creation of a simple test app to test out some different functions and such

### 11 Dec 2021

* *2 hours* Began researching how to push notifications through app, a lot harder than it seems

## Week 11

### 14 Dec 2021

* *2 hours* Found that the printer has a problem with bleeding colour, which would be okay for test models, but because of the conducting filament, there's a worry that it may disrupt how it interacts with the screen, messaged Marco and got some advice

* *5 hours* Attempted some different methods of scheduling notifications, so far no results. Also linked up old phone that can be tested on with the app to streamline manual tests a bit

### 16 Dec 2021

* *1 hour* Completed the status report and sent to supervisor

* *2 hours* Started a print to create a model for testing with the app

* *3 hours* Further work on the app, successfully created push notifications, and scheduling in short term, performing long term test
